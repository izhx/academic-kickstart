This article aims for a brief survey on this topic. The parsing community includes many tasks, which are difficult to be covered fully. Here we focus on two of the most popular formalizations of parsing: constituent parsing and dependency parsing. Constituent parsing is majorly targeted to syntactic analysis, and dependency parsing can handle both syntactic and semantic analysis. This article briefly reviews the representative models of constituent parsing and dependency parsing, and also dependency graph parsing with rich semantics. Besides, we also review the closely-related topics such as cross-domain, cross-lingual and joint parsing models, parser application as well as corpus development of parsing in the article.","tags":["Survey"],"title":"A Survey of Syntactic-Semantic Parsing Based on Constituent and Dependency Structures","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Qiankun Fu","Yue Zhang","Jiangming Liu","张梅山"],"categories":["Paper"],"content":"","date":1588723200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1588723200,"objectID":"6436213b3e30d8c9d62901ed9114277a","permalink":"/publication/fqk2020acl/","publishdate":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/fqk2020acl/","section":"publication","summary":"Discourse representation tree structure (DRTS) parsing is a novel semantic parsing task which has been concerned most recently. State-of-the-art performance can be achieved by a neural sequence-to-sequence model, treating the tree construction as an incremental sequence generation problem. Structural information such as input syntax and the intermediate skeleton of the partial output has been ignored in the model, which could be potentially useful for the DRTS parsing. In this work, we propose a structural-aware model at both the encoder and decoder phase to integrate the structural information, where graph attention network (GAT) is exploited for effectively modeling. Experimental results on a benchmark dataset show that our proposed model is effective and can obtain the best performance in the literature.","tags":["ACL"],"title":"DRTS Parsing with Structure-Aware Encoding and Decoding","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hao Fei","张梅山","Donghong Ji"],"categories":["Paper"],"content":"","date":1586131200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1586131200,"objectID":"6cc2c55223e2f458f5b747f80780d077","permalink":"/publication/fh2020acl/","publishdate":"2020-04-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/fh2020acl/","section":"publication","summary":"Many efforts of research are devoted to semantic role labeling (SRL) which is crucial for natural language understanding. Supervised approaches have achieved impressing performances when large-scale corpora are available for resource-rich languages such as English. While for the low-resource languages with no annotated SRL dataset, it is still challenging to obtain competitive performances. Cross-lingual SRL is one promising way to address the problem, which has achieved great advances with the help of model transferring and annotation projection. In this paper, we propose a novel alternative based on corpus translation, constructing high-quality training datasets for the target languages from the source gold-standard SRL annotations. Experimental results on Universal Proposition Bank show that the translation-based method is highly effective, and the automatic pseudo datasets can improve the target-language SRL performances significantly.","tags":["ACL","SRL"],"title":"Cross-Lingual Semantic Role Labeling with High-Quality Translated Training Corpus","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1530144000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1530144000,"objectID":"8795eba9bd19b87b0616d17da3c16590","permalink":"/join/","publishdate":"2018-06-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/join/","section":"","summary":"Here we describe how to add a page to your site.","tags":null,"title":"加入我们","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1530144000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1530144000,"objectID":"c1d17ff2b20dca0ad6653a3161942b64","permalink":"/people/","publishdate":"2018-06-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/people/","section":"","summary":"Here we describe how to add a page to your site.","tags":null,"title":"团队成员","type":"widget_page"}]
